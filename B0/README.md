#### ii. Brief documentation about your game (how is it played, what are the special features, what else have you added, what are the keys, etc.)

The game is simple!! Collect the collectibles before your opponent does or get ready to get roasted. 12 collectibles, 2 players. Touch the wall and lose points. Couldn't get ball collision to work as good as I wanted to since I joined the class late. P1 controls are the arrow keys and P2 controls are standard alternate "WASD" keys. Jump over is implemented. Fixed camera, worked over ball jumping too. 120 seconds is all you got. 

#### iii. A description of the extra credit attempts.

Only announcement extra credit implemented like announcing who won, notification when 30 sec left. No point to announce when the ball collides as I couldn't get collision to work.
